# Thesis Abstraction

## Design objectives

1. **Verifiability**: Any _falsified/corrupted information_ a node receives from the Orchestrator server or other peer nodes can be _independently verified_. However, this comes at the cost of not guaranteeing the availability of the service if the Orchestrator server intentionally delays or provides falsified/corrupted information.

2. **Byzantine fault tolerance**: The network is fault-tolerant up to a threshold of $t$ such that $n/2 < t \leq n$. In the most extreme case where an attacker simultaneously controls both the Orchestrator server and $t - 1$ nodes, the system must still ensure cryptographic safety, meaning it is impossible to generate a valid signature pair for any state that is fraudulent or affects the state of the remaining $t$ honest nodes.

3. **Commitment of the signature**: A transaction once signed must be _atomic and committed_. Even when $\geq t$ nodes go offline simultaneously, any transaction that has been signed and confirmed in the past can still be _unilaterally settled on-chain_ by anyone without causing a conflict or exposing a vulnerability that would freeze latest valid state by any kind of attacks.

## Optimization strategies

1. **Optimizing input throughput**: Instead of signing directly on each individual transaction, the system signs indirectly on the cumulative state of the entire fund. This strategy allows an unlimited number of micro-transactions to be aggregated off-chain into a single settlement message, maximizing throughput and reducing transaction fees to near-zero.

2. **Optimizing output throughput**: Instead of performing direct transfers at each settlement, the Smart Contract adopts a proactive pull-model.

3. **Optimizing data structure and blockchain costs**: Instead of having Smart Contract to update the cumulative state for each user at each settlement, the system uses a Sparse Merkle Tree approach. This strategy allows the Smart Contract to perform only a fixed $O(1)$ complexity of Merkle Root reassignment (settlement) and proof verification (fund withdrawal). Additionally, the Merkle root is optimized to just a fixed-size `32-bytes` value by precomputing the values of empty branches for all $2^{256}$ states.

4. **Optimizing consensus process and native multi-chain support**: Instead of having on-chain threshold consensus, the system moves the consensus process to an off-chain network by utilizing mathematical properties to constrain the ability to generate threshold signatures. Additionally, the off-chain consensus process naturally enables native multi-chain support.

5. **Optimizing cryptographic security**: Instead of using only a single **Feldman Verifiable Secret Sharing** phase for the Distributed Key Generation, the system adds **Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing** to address the waiting attack vulnerability and employs **Threshold Signature Scheme** to ensure that the fund's private key exists only mathematically but is never reconstructed anywhere in memory.

6. **Optimizing network complexity**:  Instead of using a fully distributed architecture with communication complexity of $O(n^2)$ and $O(t^2)$, the system employs a central Orchestrator server to aggregate messages, reducing complexity to linear $O(n)$ and $O(t)$ without compromising cryptographic security.

7. **Optimizing transaction finality**: Instead of having a lock-time to handle the latest state dispute, the system relies on cumulative state and one-way transaction properties to eliminate the possibility of forking or state dispute.

# TSS Node P2P (alternative architecture)

This repository contains the implementation of a participant node $\mathcal{P}_i$ in the fully decentralized distributed fund system. Each node securely holds a fractional secret polynomial share $x_i$ without exposing it to external parties.

The system implements a **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** protocol using **Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS)**, a **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)** based on the **GG18** specification over the `secp256k1` elliptic curve, and a **Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)** to manage and verify users' cumulative balances.

Nodes communicate directly with each other via Peer-to-Peer RESTful API requests. For the proposed architecture, please refer to [@SnowyField1906/tss-node](https://github.com/SnowyField1906/tss-node).

## Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

The DKG process ensures that no single entity possesses the full private key. It establishes the system parameters $(t, n)$, requiring a threshold $t$ to reconstruct the original private key.

- **Broadcast Phase (`POST /dkg/broadcast`):**
  - Each node generates a secret polynomial $f(x)$ and a blinding polynomial $g(x)$ of degree $t-1$.
  - It evaluates points $s_{i,j}$ and $t_{i,j}$ for every peer $j$.
  - It generates a 1028-bit Paillier Homomorphic Encryption keypair for future additive operations.
  - It broadcasts Pedersen Commitments $C_k = f_k G + g_k H$ to allow public verification of its shares without revealing the actual values directly to all peers.
- **Receive Phase (`POST /dkg/receive`):**
  - Receives encrypted secret and noise fragments from peers via ECIES encryption. It validates the integrity of these shares against the sender's Pedersen Commitments.
  - Aggregates the validated fragments to compute its master secret share $x_i = \sum s_{j,i} \pmod q$.
  - Generates and returns Feldman Commitments $A_{i,k} = a_{i,k}G$ to prove the correctness of its derived secret share.
- **Compute Public Key Phase (`POST /dkg/compute-public-key`):**
  - Self-verifies the master share against all network Feldman commitments.
  - Reconstructs and saves the globally aggregated uncompressed public key $Y = \sum A_{i,0}$, which is used for on-chain signature verification.

## Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)

The SMT manages and verifies users' cumulative balances. It's a data structure that allows for a fixed-size `32-byte` storage and $O(1)$ verification without scaling along with the number of users or transactions.

Before signing, a node independently calculates the impending system state using a local SMT.

- Retrieves the latest global state from peers via `GET /fund/latest-state` to ensure its `nonce` is up-to-date and to verify the old state's signature if its local replica is out of sync.
- Validates the incoming Merkle Proof of the requesting user.
- Updates the local SMT off-chain by accumulating the user's balance, computes the new Merkle Root via binary `Buffer` concatenations, and constructs the deterministic `messageHash`.
- Saves this transition to the local `PendingTransaction` collection.
- Dispatches the proposal directly to all peers via `POST /tss/propose`. The node keeps distinct `pendingTransaction` records separated by `chainId` to prevent overlapping states.

## Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)

The TSS process is based on the GG18 protocol. It uses Homomorphic Encryption to perform operations on encrypted values, allowing $t$ nodes to collaboratively generate a valid signature without reconstructing the private key in memory.

Once a node receives $t$ identical transaction proposals, or directly acts as a proposer, the interactive GG18 signing cycle begins.

- **Start Phase (`POST /tss/start`):**
  - Generates ephemeral random scalars: nonce share $k_i$ and auxiliary masking variable $\gamma_i$.
  - Computes the subset-specific Lagrange interpolated share: $w_i = x_i \lambda_{i,S} \pmod q$.
  - Encrypts these values under its own Paillier public key: $E_i(k_i)$ and $E_i(w_i)$.
  - Proposer node directly triggers this phase on peers.
- **Multiplicative-to-Additive Phase (`POST /tss/mta`):**
  - Transforms the distributed product of secrets into a sum of shares.
  - To prevent vulnerability from negative values causing modulo wrap-around in Paillier encryption, the node applies Additive Blinding. It generates random scalars $\beta'$ and $\mu'$, stores their modulo $q$ complements ($\beta_{ij}, \mu_{ij}$), and uses Homomorphic Addition to mask the ciphertexts. This prevents numerical overflow exceeding the Paillier key length.
  - Outputs ciphertext shares $\alpha_{ij}$ (for $k\gamma$) and $\nu_{ij}$ (for $x\gamma$) to peers.
- **Delta & Sigma (`POST /tss/delta`):**
  - Decrypts the incoming masked MtA shares.
  - Computes the local additive components: $\delta_i = k_i\gamma_i + \sum(\alpha_{ji} + \beta_{ij}) \pmod q$ and $\sigma_i = k_iw_i + \sum(\nu_{ji} + \mu_{ij}) \pmod q$.
- **Sign (`POST /tss/sign`):**
  - Receives the global curve extraction $r$.
  - Evaluates the partial ECDSA signature equation: $s_i = m \cdot k_i + r \cdot \sigma_i \pmod q$.
  - Commits the transaction to the local database via atomic updates into the `Key` and `Fund` document and deletes the `PendingTransaction` to finalize the process.
